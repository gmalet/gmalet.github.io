In my research, I study the domestic sources of international cooperation, especially in the context of the European Union. At the crossroad of European politics and EU politics, my research agenda analyzes how voters form their political preferences and at which level of government they want their preferences to be addressed. In particular, I am interested in how voters learn from foreign developments, how they respond to party discourse, and how the interactions between voters and parties shape the course of European integration.
