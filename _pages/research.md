My research focuses on public opinion and party competition, with a special focus on the domestic politics of European integration. At the crossroad of European politics and EU politics, my research agenda examines both how voters form their political preferences and how party elites respond to these preferences. In particular, I am interested in how voters learn from foreign developments, how they shape and respond to party discourse, and how the policies produced by the European Union affect whether people support a political authority beyond the nation state.
