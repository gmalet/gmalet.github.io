I am a senior researcher and an SNSF Ambizione Fellow at ETH ZÃ¼rich (European Politics Group). I completed my doctorate at the European University Institute with a thesis on the political consequences of mass Euroscepticism. During my PhD, I held visiting positions at the University of California, Berkeley and at the London School of Economics. Before joining the ETH, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, working on an ERC-project on "The mass politics of disintegration". My research focuses on public opinion and democratic representation in multilevel systems, and has been published, among others, in <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, the <em>European Journal of Political Research</em>, <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>, and the <em>Journal of European Public Policy</em>.
