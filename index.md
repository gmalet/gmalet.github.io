I am a senior researcher and an SNSF Ambizione Fellow at ETH ZÃ¼rich (European Politics Group). I completed my doctorate at the European University Institute with a thesis on the political consequences of mass Euroscepticism. During my PhD, I held visiting positions at the University of California, Berkeley and at the London School of Economics. Before joining the ETH, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich, working on an ERC-project on "The mass politics of disintegration". My research focuses on public opinion and democratic representation in multilevel systems, and has been published, among others, in Comparative Political Studies, the European Journal of Political Research, and the Journal of European Public Policy.
